pHomomorphism
=============

The package is written as a part of Service Suggestion Engine 
to work with 
 package to calculate p-Homomorphism mapping between Two Graphs.
It takes in two graphs as Adjacency Lists or Adjacency Matrix and calculates p-Homomorphism Mapping.

The Implementation is based on Algorithms in the paper : 
Graph homomorphism revisited for graph matching (dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1920986)
